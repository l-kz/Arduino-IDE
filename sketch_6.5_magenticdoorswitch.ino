//Connect one wire of the magnetic door switch to GPIO pin 21 on your ESP32 board.
//Connect a 10kÎ© resistor between GPIO pin 21 and the positive VCC rail (3.3V).
//Connect the other wire of the magnetic door switch to the ground (GND) rail.
//After connecting the door switch, you can use the following code to verify its operation:


#define DOOR_PIN 21

  delay(1000); // Delay for 1 second before reading again
